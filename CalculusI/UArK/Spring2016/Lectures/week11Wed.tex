\item \S 3.11 Related Rates
\begin{itemize}\footnotesize
	\item Know the steps to solving related rates problems, and be able to use them to solve problems given variables and rates of change.
	\item Be able to solve related rates problems.  If, while doing the HW (paper or computer), you were provided a formula in order to solve the problem, then I will do the same.  If you were not provided a formula while doing the HW (paper or computer), then I also will not provide the formula.

	\item Know how to find critical points for a function.
	\item Given a function on a given interval, be able to find local and/or absolute extrema.

\item \S 4.2 What Derivatives Tell Us
%\footnotesize
	\begin{itemize}\footnotesize
	\item Be able to use the first derivative to determine where a function is increasing or decreasing.
	\item Be able to use the \alert{First Derivative Test to identify local maxima and minima}.  Be able to explain in words how you arrived at your conclusion.
	\item Be able to find critical points, absolute extrema, and inflection points for a function.
	\item Be able to use the second derivative to determine the concavity of a function.
	\item Be able to use the \alert{Second Derivative Test to determine whether a given point is a local max or min}.  Be able to explain in words how you arrived at your conclusion.
	\item Know your Derivative Properties!!! (see Figure 4.36 on p.\ 256)

\item \S 4.3 Graphing Functions
%\small
	\begin{itemize}\footnotesize
	\item Be able to find specific characteristics of a function that are spelled out in the Graphing Guidelines on p.\ 261 (e.g., know how to find $x$- and $y$-intercepts, vertical/horizontal asymptotes, critical points, inflection points, intervals of concavity and increasing/decreasing, etc.).  
	\item Be able to use these specific characteristics of a function to sketch a graph of the function.
	%\item TIP: If you are looking for intervals for increasing/decreasing or concave up/down, you should {\it treat} the naughty points as critical points and/or possible points of inflection.
