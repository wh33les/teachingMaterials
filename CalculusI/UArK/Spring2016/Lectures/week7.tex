% % %

\begin{frame}{\S 3.9 Derivatives of Logarithmic and Exponential Functions}\footnotesize
The natural exponential function $f(x)=e^x$ has an inverse function, namely $f^{-1}(x)=\ln x$.  This relationship has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $e^{\ln x}=x $ for $x>0$ and $\ln(e^x)=x$ for all $x$.
\item[2.] $y=\ln x \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad x=e^y$
\item[3.] For real numbers $x$ and $b>0$, 
\[b^x=e^{\ln (b^x)}=e^{x \ln b}.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Derivative of $y=\ln x$}
% % % 

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Derivative of $y=\ln x$}\footnotesize
Using 2. from the last slide, plus implicit differentiation, we can find $\textstyle\frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln x\right)$.  Write $y=\ln x$.  We wish to find $\textstyle\frac{dy}{dx}$.  From 2.,
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}\big(x=e^y\big) \Rightarrow \frac{d}{dx}x &= \frac{d}{dx}(e^y) \\[0.5pc]
1 &= e^y\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) \\[0.5pc]
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{1}{e^y}=\frac{1}{x} 
\end{align*}
So \alert{$\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x)=\frac{1}{x}$}.
\end{frame}

% % %
\subsubsection{Derivative of $y=\ln{|x|}$}
% % %

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Derivative of $y=\ln |x|$}\footnotesize
Recall, we can only take ``$\ln{}$" of a positive number.  However:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $x>0$, $\ln |x| = \ln x$, so 
\[\frac{d}{dx} (\ln |x|)=\frac{1}{x}.\]
\item For $x<0$, $\ln |x| = \ln(-x)$, so 
\[\frac{d}{dx} (\ln |x|)= \frac{d}{dx} (\ln(-x)) = \frac{1}{-x} \cdot (-1) = \frac{1}{x}.\]
\end{itemize}
In other words, the absolute values do not change the derivative of natural log.
%\[\frac{d}{dx}(\ln x)=\frac{d}{dx}(\ln |x|)=\frac{1}{x}.\]
\end{frame}

\begin{exe} Find the derivative of each of the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x)=\ln(15x)$

\end{itemize}
\end{exe}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection{Derivative of $y=b^x$}
% % %

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Derivative of $y=b^x$}
What about other logs?  Say $b>0$.  Since $b^x=e^{\ln b^x}=e^{x \ln b}$ (by 3. on the earlier slide), 
\begin{align*}
\alert{\frac{d}{dx}(b^x)} &= \frac{d}{dx}(e^{x \ln b}) \\[0.75pc]
 &=e^{x \ln b} \cdot \ln b \\[0.75pc]
 &= \alert{b^x \ln b}.

\begin{frame}{\small Derivatives of General Logarithmic Functions}\footnotesize
The relationship $y=\ln x \Longleftrightarrow x=e^y$ applies to logarithms of other bases:
\[y=\log_b x \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad x=b^y.\]
Now taking $\textstyle\frac{d}{dx}\left(x=b^y\right)$ we obtain
\vspace{-0.75pc}
\begin{align*}
1 &= b^y\ln b\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right) \\
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{1}{b^y \ln b} \\[0.5pc]
\alert{\frac{d}{dx}(\log_b x)} &=\alert{\frac{1}{x \ln b}} 
\end{align*}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\begin{ex}
The derivative of $f(x)=\log_2{(10x)}$ is
\begin{itemize}
\item[A. ] $\textstyle\frac{1}{10x}$
\item[B. ] $\textstyle\frac{1}{x\ln 2}$
\item[C. ] $\textstyle\frac{1}{x}$
\item[D. ] $\textstyle\frac{10}{x\ln 2}$

\begin{frame}{\small Neat Trick: Logarithmic Differentiation}
\begin{ex}  Compute the derivative of $f(x)=\frac{x^2(x-1)^3}{(3+5x)^4}$. \end{ex}
{\bf Solution:} We can use logarithmic differentiation -- first take the natural log of both sides and then use properties of logarithms.
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}\footnotesize
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\alert{\ln(}f(x)\alert{)} &= \alert{\ln \Big(} \frac{x^2(x-1)^3}{(3+5x)^4} \alert{\Big)} \\%[0.5pc]
&= \ln{x^2} + \ln{(x-1)^3}-\ln{(3+5x)^4} \\%[0.5pc]
&= 2\ln x + 3\ln(x-1)-4\ln(3+5x)
\end{alignat*}
\alert{Now} we take $\textstyle\frac{d}{dx}$ on both sides:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\frac{1}{f(x)}\left(\frac{df}{dx}\right) &= 2\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + 3\left(\frac{1}{x-1}\right) - 4\left(\frac{1}{3+5x}\right)(5) \\[1pc]
\frac{f^{\prime}(x)}{f(x)} &= \frac{2}{x} + \frac{3}{x-1} - \frac{20}{3+5x}
\end{alignat*}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}{}
Finally, solve for $f^{\prime}(x)$:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
f^{\prime}(x) &= \alert{f(x)} \left[ \frac{2}{x} + \frac{3}{x-1} - \frac{20}{3+5x} \right] \\[1pc]
&= \alert{\frac{x^2 (x-1)^3}{(3+5x)^4}} \left[ \frac{2}{x} + \frac{3}{x-1} - \frac{20}{3+5x} \right]
\end{alignat*}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\begin{exe}
Use logarithmic differentiation to calculate the derivative of 
\[
f(x)=\frac{(x+1)^{\frac{3}{2}}(x-4)^{\frac{5}{2}}}{(5x+3)^{\frac{2}{3}}}.

\subsubsection{Running Out of Time on the Exam Plus other Study Tips}
% % %
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{\small Running Out of Time on the Exam Plus other Study Tips}\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Do practice problems completely, from beginning to end (as if it were a quiz).  You might think you understand something but when it's time to write down the details things are not so clear.  
\item Find a buddy who understands concepts a little better than you and work on problems for 2-3 hours.  Then find a buddy who is struggling and work with them 2-3 hours.  %Explaining to someone else tests how deeply you really know the material.  This strategy also helps reduce stress because it doesn't require you to devote a full day or night of studying, just 2-3 hours at a time of productive work.
\item Don't count on cookie cutter problems.  If you are doing a practice problem where you've memorized all the steps, make sure you understand why each step is needed.  The exam problems may have a small variation from homeworks and quizzes.  If you're not prepared, it'll come as a ``twist" on the exam...
%
\framebreak
\item If you encounter an unfamiliar type of problem on the exam, relax, because it's most likely not a trick!  The solutions will always rely on the information from the required reading/assignments.  Take your time and do each baby step carefully.  
\item During the exam, do the problems you are most confident with first!  %Different people will find different problems easier.
\item During the exam, budget your time.  Count the problems and divide by 50 minutes.  The easier questions will take less time so doing them first leaves extra time for the harder ones.  When studying, aim for 10 problems per hour (i.e., 6 minutes per problem).
%
\framebreak
\item Always make sure you \alert{answer the question}.  This is also a good strategy if you're not sure how to start a problem, figure out what the question wants first.
\item The exam is not a race.  If you finish early take advantage of the time to check your work.  You don't want to leave feeling smug about how quickly you finished only to find out next week you lost a letter grade's worth of points from silly mistakes.

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Other Study Tips}
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Brush up on algebra, especially radicals, logs, common denominators, etc.  Many times knowing the right algebra will simplify the problem!
\item When in doubt, show steps.  
\item You will be punished for wrong notation.  The slides for \S 3.1 show different notations for the derivative.  Make sure whichever one you use in your work, that you are using it correctly.
\item Read the question!  
\item Do the book problems.
\item Look at the pictures in the book and the interactive applets on MLP.
