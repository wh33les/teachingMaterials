\begin{frame}{\small Graphing the Derivative}
The graph of the derivative is the graph of the collection of slopes of tangent lines of a graph.  If you just have a graph (without an equation for the graph), the best you can do is approximate the graph of the derivative.

	\item[3.]  Note where $f^{\prime}(x)<0$.  (What does this look like?)

\subsubsection{Differentiability vs. Continuity}

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Differentiability vs. Continuity}
Key points about the relationship between differentiability and continuity:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
\item If $f$ is not continuous at $a$, then $f$ is not differentiable at $a$.
\item $f$ can be continuous at $a$, but not differentiable at $a$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}{}
A function $f$ is \alert{not} differentiable at $a$ if at least one of the following conditions holds:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $f$ is not continuous at $a$.
\item[2.] $f$ has a corner at $a$.  
\begin{que} Why does this make $f$ not differentiable? \end{que}
\item[3.] $f$ has a vertical tangent at $a$.  
\begin{que} Why does this make $f$ not differentiable? \end{que}

% % %
\begin{frame}{\small Other Study Tips}\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Brush up on algebra, especially radicals.
%\item If your answer is something like $\sqrt 2$, don't plug that into your calculator, just leave it as is.
\item When in doubt, show steps.  Defer to class notes and old exams to get an idea of what's expected.
\item You will be punished for wrong notation; e.g., the limit symbol.
\item Read the question!  Several students always lose points because they didn't answer the question or they didn't follow directions.
\item Do the book problems.
%\item Look at the pictures in the book and the interactive applets on MLP.
\item Budget your time.  You don't have to do the problems in order.  Do the easier ones first.
