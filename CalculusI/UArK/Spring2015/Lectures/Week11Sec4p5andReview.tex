\subsection[$\oint 4.5$ Linear Approximation and Differentials]{$\oint 4.5$ Linear Approximation and Differentials}
\frametitle{$\oint 4.5$ Linear Approximation and Differentials}
\footnotesize
Suppose $f$ is a function such that $f^{\prime}$ exists at some point $P$.  If you zoom in on the graph, the curve appears more and more like the tangent line to $f$ at $P$.

\frametitle{\small Linear Approximation}
\footnotesize
This idea -- that \alert{smooth} curves (i.e., curves without corners) appear straighter on smaller scales -- is the basis of linear approximations.

\vspace{1pc}
One of the properties of a function that is \alert{differentiable} at a point $P$ is that it is \alert{locally linear} near $P$ (i.e., the curve approaches the tangent line at $P$.)

\vspace{1pc}
Therefore, it makes sense to approximate a function with its tangent line, which matches the value and slope of the function at $P$.  

\vspace{1pc}
This is why you've had to do so many ``find the equation for the tangent line to the given point" problems!
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\footnotesize
\begin{dfn} Suppose $f$ is differentiable on an interval $I$ containing the point $a$.  The {\bf linear approximation} to $f$ at $a$ is the linear function
\[L(x)=f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(x-a)\qquad\text{for $x$ in $I$.}\]
\end{dfn}

\vspace{1pc}
{\bf Remarks:} Compare this definition to the following: At a given point $P=(a,f(a))$, the slope of the line tangent to the curve at $P$ is $f^{\prime}(a)$.  So the equation of the tangent line is
\[y-f(a)=f^{\prime}(a)(x-a).\]

(Yes, it is the same thing!)
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\small
\begin{exe} Write the equation of the line that represents the linear approximation to 
\[f(x)=\dfrac{x}{x+1}\qquad\text{ at $a=1$.}\]  
Then {\it use} the linear approximation to estimate $f(1.1)$. \end{exe}

\vspace{1pc}
{\bf Solution:} First compute
\[f^{\prime}(x)=\dfrac{1}{(x+1)^2},\quad f(a)=\dfrac{1}{2},\quad f^{\prime}(a)=\dfrac{1}{4}\]
\[L(x)=\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}(x-1)=\dfrac{1}{4}x+\dfrac{1}{4}.\]
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\small
{\bf Solution (continued):}

\bigskip

Because $x=1.1$ is near $a=1$, we can estimate $f(1.1)$ using $L(1.1)$:
$$f(1.1) \approx L(1.1)= 0.525$$

\bigskip

Note that $f(1.1)=0.5238$, so the error in this estimation is
$$\dfrac{0.525-0.5238}{0.5238} \times 100=0.23 \%.$$
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\small Intro to Differentials}
\small
Our linear approximation $L(x)$ is used to approximate $f(x)$ when $a$ is fixed and $x$ is a nearby point:
\[f(x) \approx f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(x-a)\]

\vspace{1pc}
When rewritten,
\begin{align*}
f(x)-f(a) & \approx f^{\prime}(a)(x-a) \\[0.5pc]
\implies \Delta y & \approx f^{\prime}(a) \Delta x.
\end{align*}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\footnotesize
A change in $y$ can be approximated by the corresponding change in $x$, magnified or diminished by a factor of $f^{\prime}(a)$.  

\vspace{1pc}
This is another way to say that $f^{\prime}(a)$ is the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$!
\begin{align*}
\Delta y & \approx f^{\prime}(a) \Delta x \\[0.5pc]
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} & \approx f^{\prime}(a)
\end{align*}

\vspace{1pc}
So if $f$ is differentiable on an interval $I$ containing the point $a$, then the change in the value of $f$ (the $\Delta y$), between two points $a$ and $a+\Delta x$ in $I$, is \alert{approximately} $f'(x)\Delta x$. 
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\small
We now have two different, but related quantities:

\begin{itemize}
\item The change in the function $y=f(x)$ as $x$ changes from $a$ to $a+\Delta x$ (which we call $\Delta y$).

\vspace{0.5pc}
\item The change in the linear approximation $y=L(x)$ as $x$ changes from $a$ to $a+\Delta x$ (called the \alert{differential}, $dy$).
\end{itemize}

%\vspace{0.5pc}
\[\Delta y \approx dy\]
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\small
When the $x$-coordinate changes from $a$ to $a+\Delta x$:
\begin{itemize}
\item The function change is \underline{{\bf exactly}} $\Delta y=f(a+\Delta x)-f(a)$.
\item The linear approximation change is 
\begin{alignat*}{2}
\Delta L &= L(a+\Delta x)-L(a) \\[0.5pc]
&= \left( f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(a+\Delta x -a) \right) - \left( f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(a-a) \right) \\[0.5pc]
&= f^{\prime}(a) \Delta x
\end{alignat*}
and this is $dy$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\small
We define the differentials $dx$ and $dy$ to distinguish between the \alert{change in the function ($\Delta y$)} and the \alert{change in the linear approximation ($\Delta L$)}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $dx$ is simply the change in $x$, i.e.\ $\Delta x$.
%\vspace{0.25pc}
\item $dy$ is the change in the linear approximation, which is $\Delta L=f^{\prime}(a) \Delta x$.
\end{itemize}

{\bf SO:}
\begin{align*}
\Delta L &= f^{\prime}(a) \Delta x \\[0.5pc]
dy &= f^{\prime}(a) dx \\[0.5pc]
\dfrac{dy}{dx} &= f^{\prime}(a)\quad \text{ (at $x=a$)}
\end{align*}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\small
\begin{dfn} Let $f$ be differentiable on an interval containing $x$.
\begin{itemize}
\item A small change in $x$ is denoted by the {\bf differential} $dx$.
\item The corresponding change in $y=f(x)$ is \underline{approximated} by the {\bf differential} $dy=f^{\prime}(x)dx$; that is,
\begin{align*}
\Delta y& = f(x+\Delta x)-f(x) \\[0.5pc]
\approx dy &= f^{\prime}(x)dx.
\end{align*}
\end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\vspace{1pc}
{\bf The use of differentials is critical as we approach integration.}
\end{frame}

% % %
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\small
\begin{ex} Use the notation of differentials $[dy = f^{\prime}(x) dx]$ to approximate the change in $f(x)=x-x^3$ given a small change $dx$. \end{ex}

{\bf Solution:}

$f^{\prime}(x)=1-3x^2$, so $dy=(1-3x^2)dx.$

A small change $dx$ in the variable $x$ produces an approximate change of $dy=(1-3x^2)dx$ in $y$.

\vspace{1.5pc}
For example, if $x$ increases from 2 to 2.1, then $dx=0.1$ and 
\[dy=\left(1-3(2)^2 \right)(0.1)=-1.1.\]
This means as $x$ increases by 0.1, $y$ decreases by 1.1.

\item one $3\times 5$ inch notecard, one-sided only
\item Read the question!  
\item Do the book problems.
\item Find a buddy who understands concepts a little better than you and work on problems for 2-3 hours.  Then find a buddy who is struggling and work with them 2-3 hours.  Explaining to someone else tests how deeply you really know the material.  This strategy also helps reduce stress because it doesn't require you to devote a full day or night of studying, just 2-3 hours at a time of productive work.

\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item If you encounter an unfamiliar type of problem on the exam, relax, because it's most likely not a trick.  The solutions will always rely on the information from the required reading/assignments.  Take your time and do each baby step carefully.  
\item During the exam, do the problems you are most confident with first!  Different people will find different problems easier.
\item The exam is not a race.  If you finish early take advantage of the time to check your work.  You don't want to leave feeling smug about how quickly you finished only to find out next week you lost a letter grade's worth of points from silly mistakes.
\item Algebra: Look at solutions to Quiz 10 (and others).
