You have 30 minutes to complete this quiz.  Make your variables clear and
consistent (so if you want to say, for example, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, you should also
mention $y=f(x)$, or ``$y$ is a function of $x$'').  Calculators are OK.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that a company (called All
Things Food) has hired you as a consultant. You are to
help them
save their failing product, ``Big J's Bar-B-Q Ice
Cream.'' You
have discovered that their cost and revenue functions
(in dollars)
are:
$$C(q)= 100 + 2q \qquad{\rm and}\qquad
R(q)= 15 q^{0.75},$$ where $q$ is the
number of ice cream containers produced. 

\vspace{0.3in}
\noindent {\bf a)} What is the product's fixed cost?

\vspace{1.0in}
\noindent {\bf b)} Last year, All Things Food produced
$2400$ containers of Big J's Bar-B-Q Ice Cream. What
was their
profit?

\vspace{1.5in}
\noindent {\bf c)} Find formulas for marginal cost and
marginal revenue, and evaluate at
$q=2400$.

\vspace{.4in}
$MC(q) = $

\vspace{0.4in}
$MC(2400) =$

\vspace{0.4in}
$MR(q) = $

\vspace{0.4in}
$MR(2400) =$

\vspace{0.4in}
\noindent {\bf d)} Big J wants to increase production
to
do better this year. Based on the marginal revenue and
marginal
cost {\it at this point} ($q=2400$), explain whether
Big J's
strategy is sound. 

\vspace{2.0in}
\noindent {\bf e)} What production level will maximize
the profit available to the company?

\vspace{2.0in}
\item The metal frame of a rectangular box has a square base.  The horizontal rods in the base are made out of one metal and the vertical rods are made out of a different metal.  If the horizontal rods expand at a rate of 0.001 cm/hr and the vertical rods expand at a rate of 0.002 cm/hr, at what rate is the volume of the box expanding when the base has an area of 9 cm$^2$ and the volume is 180 cm$^3$?
