\section{\sc Required Materials}
\begin{list1}
\item MYLABSPLUS (MLP) Student Access Kit 
\item Turning Technologies response card (clicker)
\end{list1}

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Textbook} \emph{Calculus: Early Transcendentals}, by Briggs \& Cochran \\
The textbook {\bf is not required} since an electronic version is included in the MLP kit.  

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Software} The \emph{MYLABSPLUS (MLP) Student Access Kit} {\bf is required} for this class. If you took Calculus at UArk within the past year or so, you shouldn't need to purchase the kit. To log in to MLP, 
\begin{list1} 
\item Go to \verb+http://uark.bb.mylabsplus.com+. 
\item Find and click the "Forgot your password" link (If you've used MLP before and remember your password, you can skip this step).
\item Enter the first part of your uark email address in the box labeled "User ID:" (e.g., if you were mathstudent@uark.edu, you would enter "mathstudent").  
\item Check your email for a message with the subject "Password Reset Information" from PasswordReset@ResetCredentials.com, and follow the directions in the email.
\item Troubleshooting: 
	\begin{list2}
	\item If your login fails, check that you typed in the correct URL. 
	\item If you are able to open your course but you are not able to access your assignments, please try again.  
	\item After trying a few times, if you still receive some type of an error message,
		\begin{list2}
		\item contact the MLP Technical Support line at 888-883-1299 (available 24/7), or 
		\item click on the Support Tab and then click on the email address. 
		\end{list2}
	\item If you contact the company then make sure they give you a case number and keep that number in case it is needed for verification. 
	\end{list2}
\item Be sure your browser will support the MLP software.  Most importantly, {\bf RUN THE BROWSER CHECK} once you get started. On-campus assistance is available in the Mathematics Resource and Teaching Center (MRTC), located on the third floor of Champions Hall.  
\item From time to time, you may receive messages that your session has timed out. To resolve this issue, either 
	\begin{list2}
	\item delete the cookies from your computer or 
	\item try logging in with a different browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
	\end{list2}
\item See the course webpage for other links related to MLP technical support.	
\end{list1}

\section{\sc Calculators} Sliderules are permitted, but not required.  If you prefer to use a calculator, then we recommend the TI-30X IIS because it is the one you will be given to use in the Testing Lab (part of MRTC, on the third floor of Champions Hall).  If you have a graphing calculator, you may use it for in-class investigations and on HW.

The following are {\bf not allowed} during any exams or quizzes:
\begin{list2} 
\item programmable graphing calculators of any kind
\item HP300s 
\item Casio fx115m 
\item any calculator with a differentiation/integration button 
\end{list2}  

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Decorum} Cell phones, palm pilots, Blackberries, iPods, etc. -- please be courteous about their use during class.  {\bf Do not plan to use any such device, even as a clock, on an exam.} No earplugs/headsets allowed.

Class activities should fit as precisely into the scheduled time as possible.   I will do my best to start on time and not lecture past the end of classtime.  In return, if for whatever reason you end up late to class or if you need to leave during lecture, for example, to use the restroom, please do so as discreetly as possible.  Rolling in late and/or packing up early are considered uncool, as the noise distracts and sabotages your classmates' investment in the course. 

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Grading} There will be 700 points available as follows:

%\vspace{-.2in}
\begin{center}
\begin{supertabular}{@{}p{0.6\textwidth} l}
	{\bf Homework} & 100 points \\
		\hspace{5pt}Given by your MLP homework average. & \\
		 & \\
{\bf Quizzes} & 100 points \\
	\hspace{5pt} Average of your top 10 quizzes (out of $\sim$13). & \\
 & \\
 {\bf Three In-Class Exams} & 100 points each \\
 & \\
{\bf Final (comprehensive)} & 200 points \\
{\bf TOTAL:} & {\bf 700 points} \\
\end{supertabular}
\end{center}

%\vspace{-.2in}
Letter grades will typically follow a 90-80-70-60 scale, although your instructor reserves the right to revise downward if necessary.  For example, a 90\% or higher will always guarantee an A, but there is a possibility an 89 or 88 might end up as an A.

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Homework} The homework is assigned weekly and done entirely through MLP.  {\bf Pay attention to the deadlines.}  In particular, MLP has a "tendency" to crash within an hour of an assignment's deadline.  Don't wait until the last minute to complete assignments or else you risk missing the deadline.

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Attendance and \\ Class Participation} {\bf Lecture AND drill} attendance are part of your grade.  Attendance will be taken in lecture using the clicker.  You are required to purchase a Turning Technologies response card, unless you have previously purchased one for another class.  Clickers are sold at the University bookstore, {\bf behind the counter}.  Get your clicker as soon as possible and bring it to class every day.  Instructions on how to use it will come in class -- do not worry about registering it on Blackboard.

{\bf Your homework score will drop 10 points for every 7 unexcused absences, from either lecture or drill.}  

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Quizzes} There will be weekly quizzes.  Quizzes occur during drill and vary in length.  Some may be collaborative or open book.  In your final grade, I will take the average percent of your top 10 quizzes, out of $\sim$13.   

%\vspace{-.1in}
%%%
\section{\sc Exams} You will have three 50-minute exams throughout this semester, plus a comprehensive final.  

%\vspace{-.1in}
{\bf
\begin{tabular}{llll}
FRIDAY, 18 SEP & EXAM 1 \\
WEDNESDAY, 14 OCT & EXAM 2 \\
FRIDAY, 6 NOV & EXAM 3  \\
FRIDAY, 18 DEC 10:15a-12:15p & FINAL (for the 12:55p section) \\
MONDAY, 14 DEC 1-3p & FINAL (for the 2p section) 
\end{tabular} 
}

%\vspace{-.1in}
These exams are scheduled before the semester begins, so {\bf ELIMINATE ANY CONFLICTS NOW.} Students who are entitled to accommodation by ADA must notify their instructor, who must then notify the coordinator at least one full week in advance. Students who have a legitimate University-related conflict ($=$ same time as another University exam) with the final exam must also identify themselves at least a week in advance. Last minute requests for make-up exams may not be granted. 

%\vspace{-.1in}

\section{\sc Accommodations} Under University policy and federal and state law, students with documented disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure they receive an equal opportunity to perform in class.  If any member of the class has such a disability and needs special academic accommodations, please report to the Center for Educational Access (CEA).  Reasonable accommodations may be arranged after CEA has verified your disability.  Do not hesitate to contact me if any assistance is needed in the process.

\section{\sc Academic Inegrity} "As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is only possible when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail." 

University of Arkansas students are fully responsible for knowing and abiding by the University's Academic Integrity Policy.  See \verb+http://provost.uark.edu/+. Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.

\begin{comment}
\section{\sc Testing Lab \\ Academic Policy} The use of cell phones and any personal media devices (including iPods, PDAs, personal calculators, etc.) in any of the testing labs is strictly prohibited. Turn off all these devices BEFORE entering the Testing Lab and store them with your other belongings. Do not take out or turn on these devices until you have left the Testing Lab. No belongings, including purses or backpacks, may be brought into the lab. There is space allotted for your belongings on the shelves in the Testing Lab or in the lockers outside of SCEN 203. A violation of this policy could result in a non-replaceable zero on the quiz/exam being taken. In addition, you might be required to report to the Office of Community Standards and Student Ethics (OCSSE). 

{\bf The only items allowed at the testing machine are a pen/pencil and your University ID. Calculators and scratch paper are provided by the Testing Lab operator. }

\section{\sc Inclement Weather Policy} {\bf Class meets unless the University is closed.}  Otherwise, on-campus students are expected to be present.  Off-campus students will only be excused on days the Fayetteville Public Schools are closed due to weather.  If attendance is severely affected by weather, deadlines and exam dates may be adjusted.  Please do not call the Department of Mathematical Sciences with weather-related inquiries.  You may email me for information.

\section{\sc Emergency Procedures} Severe Weather (Tornado Warning):
\begin{list2}
\item Follow the directions of the instructor or emergency personnel.
\item Seek shelter in the basement or interior room or hallway on the lowest floor, putting as many walls as possible between you and the outside.
\item If you are in a multi-story building, and you cannot get to the lowest floor, pick a hallway in the center of the building.
\item Stay in the center of the room, away from exterior walls, windows, and doors.
\end{list2}

Violence / Active Shooter (CADD):

\vspace{-.25in}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lp{0.8\textwidth}}
{\bf \underline CALL} & 9-1-1 \\
{\bf \underline AVOID} & If possible, self-evacuate to a safe area outside the building.  Follow directions of police officers. \\
{\bf \underline DENY} & Barricade the door with desk, chairs, bookcases or any items.  Move to a place inside the room where you are not visible.  Turn off the lights and remain quiet.  Remain there until told by police it's safe. \\
