\item Read. The. Textbook.
\item ``Suggested" book problems are ALL of them.  
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We may do examples in class, if there is time.  
	\item It's in your best interest to work problems that are \alert{not} in the MLP homework, then bring the ones you struggle with to drill.
	\item In the text, oftentimes there is an example, along with a list of problems covering the same concept.
	\end{itemize}
\item Play with the applets on MLP.  This course has a lot of beautiful visuals.
\item Come to office hours!  Help with topics from lecture, checking solutions to worked problems, etc.

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{\small General Study Tips}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hopefully, you've been doing those book problems.
\item Review MLP problems.  If there was a problem you got wrong the first time, do it again until you get it perfect.
\item When doing problems, write up the answers nicely.  You don't need as much detail as Quiz 3, \alert{BUT} if you were to look at your work one year from now, you should have written enough to be able to follow it.
\item Redo quizzes, too.  Only one version of each of the first two quizzes is posted, so practice with the other versions.
\framebreak
\item Review notes from class and reread (but not too slowly) the text.  If necessary, get notes from a friend on days you missed or else reread those sections more carefully.
\item Look at pictures in the book, especially any of the applets in MLP.
\item Know the special triangles.
\item Correct any lingering algebra, trig, geometry, Cal I rustiness.
\framebreak
\item Definitions
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Know ``vocabulary words", not in order to recite the definitions, but so that you can understand what a question is asking.
	\begin{ex}[s]
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Given $\overrightarrow{r}(t)$, find the {\bf tangent vector}.
	\item {\bf smooth} vs. {\bf differentiable} (in Cal I and in Cal III)
	\item ``Parametrize..." or ``Eliminate the parameter"
	\end{enumerate}
	\end{ex}
	\end{itemize}
\framebreak
\item Formulas
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Memorize them all...
	\item \alert{OR} know a few key formulas.  Many of the others you can figure out from the context of the problem. 
	\item Some suggested key formulas:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item distance and midpoint between two given points
		\item equations for spheres and balls
		\item simple (parallel to those given by the coordinates) planes and lines
		\item both dot product formulas (and when one is more useful than the other)
		\item both projection formulas (and when one is more useful than the other)
\framebreak
		\item cross product formula and the formula for its magnitude
		\item parametrized line in $\mathbb R^3$
		\item normalization of a vector
		\item arc length
		\end{itemize}
%\framebreak
	\item Physics formulas ({\bf boldface} indicates a vector quantity):
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Work = {\bf Force} $\bullet$ {\bf displacement}
		\item {\bf torque} = {\bf radial force} $\times$ {\bf applied force}
		\item {\bf magnetic force} = (charge){\bf velocity} $\times$ {\bf magnetic field}
		\item Newton no. 2: {\bf total force} = (mass){\bf acceleration}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\framebreak	
\item Recognize key pictures: planes, lines, circles, helices.	
\item Know how to do calculus on vectors -- derivative rules, integrals, limits, continuity, story problems, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item[1. ] Count the problems.  Exam 1 had 7 problems.  With 50 minutes, each problem should take no more than 7 minutes.
\item[2. ] If there is an obivously easy problem, do it first.  Otherwise, go through the entire exam, spending up to 3 minutes per problem.  Some problems you will finish, some you won't.
\item[3. ] Of the problems you didn't finish, go back and prioritize according to those you think you know how to answer.
\item[4. ] When you get to the point where you are still stumped, check your work on the problems you did answer.
\item[5. ] Repeat Step 3.
