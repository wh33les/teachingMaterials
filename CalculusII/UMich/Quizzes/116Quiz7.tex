You have 35 minutes to complete this quiz.  Eyes on your own paper and good luck!

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Definitions/Concepts.} (1 pt ea) Decide whether each of the statements below is \emph{True} or \emph{False}.  Write the entire word \emph{True} or \emph{False}.  If the statement is false, briefly explain why. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A convergent sequence is bounded.

\vfill
\item A bounded sequence converges.

\vfill 
\item Changing a finite number of terms in a series does not change whether or not it converges, although it may change the value of its sum if it does converge.

\vfill
\item If $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n$ converges, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=0$.

\vfill
\end{enumerate}
 
\item \textbf{Questions/Problems.} {\it (from April 2011 Final Exam)} You are trapped on an island, and decide to build a signal fire to alert passing ships.  You start the fire with 200 pounds of wood.  During the course of a day, $40\%$ of the wood pile burns away (so $60\%$ remains).  At the end of each day, you add another 200 pounds of wood to the pile.  Let $W_n$ denote the weight of the wood pile immediately after adding the $n$th load of wood (the inital 200-pound pile counts as the first load).

\begin{enumerate}
\item (3 pts) Find expressions for $W_1$, $W_2$, $W_3$.

%{\it -see the solution posted on the course website -}
\vspace{10pc}
\item (3 pts) Find a closed form expression for $W_n$ (a {\it closed form} expression means your answer should not contain a large summation).

%{\it -see the solution posted on the course website -}
\vspace{8pc}
\item (2 pts) Instead of starting with 200 pounds of wood and adding 200 pounds every day, you decide to start with $P$ pounds of wood and add $P$ pounds every day.  If you plan to continue the fire indefinitely, determine the largest value of $P$ for which the weight of the wood pile will never exceed 1000 pounds.

\item \textbf{Computations/Algebra.} 
 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1 pt) Find a formula for the general term of the sequence $\frac{1}{3},\,\frac{2}{5},\,\frac{3}{7},\,\frac{4}{9},\,\frac{5}{11},\dots$.
\[s_n=\hspace{10pc}\]

%\vspace{1pc}
\item (2 pts) Does the sequence given by $s_n=\frac{2n+(-1)^n5}{4n-(-1)^n3}$ converge or diverge?  If it converges then find its limit.

\vspace{5pc}
\item (3 pts) Find the first three terms of the sequence of partial sums for the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}$.

\vspace{8pc}
\item (2 pts) Does the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n+1}{2n+3}$ converge or diverge?

\end{enumerate}
